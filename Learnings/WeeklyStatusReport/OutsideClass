Week 2
#Checked out some of the links that sir sent to think of some projects for our course project.
#Was particularly interested in the CodeExchange project and I think that I may be on to an idea for a project.

Week 3
#Discussed our idea with Sridhar sir, his initial response was good. Have to work out the details for a good proposal and think of four more projects in case that one doesn't work out.
