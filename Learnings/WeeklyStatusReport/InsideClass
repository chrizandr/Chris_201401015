What you learnt inside the class?

Week 1
# Learnt the value of quality and why it is important when designing and developing software.
# Learnt the different subsets of Quality: Satisfiers, Dissatisfiers and Delighters.
# Did a fun activity, tried to use Virtual Reality and Location based tracking to create something new. Came up with some ideas but still think that I can do better.

Week 2
# Realized why the user is important. Tried to think from the point of view of the consumer rather than the developer.
# Gained some insights into how a piece of software should function so that people will want to use it.
# Had a fun brainstorming session with Santhoshini where we thought of ideas for our course projects. Came up with three ideas that may have some scope.

Week 3
# Pondered upon the question of what software engineering really is. Tried to figure out what the discipline of SE is all about.
# Did an activity in which we compared the process of Movie Making to that of Software Engineering. Gained some insight into the different steps of software engineering.
# Got to know about the different disciplines of software engineering such as Abstraction and Decomposition. Got a formal definition of SE as defined by IEEE that I did not pay much attention to :P.

Week 4
# Learnt about the Life cycle of software. Requirements engineering and other things.
# Tried to list out the requirements of Facebook and represent them in a mathematical and diagram form.
# Important aspects of development are : Tools, Design, People, Resources.
# There are a lot of models for software development. All are different forms of the waterfall model.
# Agile frameworks are more trial and error types.

Week 5
#Learnt about the more specific software developement models.
Important ones are:
Agile
Waterfall
Evolutionary
Prototype
Spiral
#Debated on the pros and cons of the Agile model
#Discussed about methods to estimate the time and complexity of a project. They were:
Top down, Bottom Up, Expert review, LOC, function points, etc
#Learnt about the Zachman framework to represent a different aspects of development.
#Some overview of the COCOMO model for estimation
