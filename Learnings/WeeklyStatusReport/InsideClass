What you learnt inside the class?

Week 1
# Learnt the value of quality and why it is important when designing and developing software.
# Learnt the different subsets of Quality: Satisfiers, Dissatisfiers and Delighters.
# Did a fun activity, tried to use Virtual Reality and Location based tracking to create something new. Came up with some ideas but still think that I can do better.

Week 2
# Realized why the user is important. Tried to think from the point of view of the consumer rather than the developer.
# Gained some insights into how a piece of software should function so that people will want to use it.
# Had a fun brainstorming session with Santhoshini where we thought of ideas for our course projects. Came up with three ideas that may have some scope.

Week 3
# Pondered upon the question of what software engineering really is. Tried to figure out what the discipline of SE is all about.
# Did an activity in which we compared the process of Movie Making to that of Software Engineering. Gained some insight into the different steps of software engineering.
# Got to know about the different disciplines of software engineering such as Abstraction and Decomposition. Got a formal definition of SE as defined by IEEE that I did not pay much attention to :P.
